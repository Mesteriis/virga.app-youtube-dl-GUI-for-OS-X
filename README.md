When [offliberty](http://offliberty.com) seems too slow or cumbersome, other options are pricey or malwary-suspicios (hello, 4k video downloader), this app comes handy.

virga.app: youtube downloader for OS X (GUI for youtube-dl)
==============
Minimalistic one-button "GUI" for youtube-dl, written in AppleScript (hence for OS X only, tested in Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan).  
virga can download videos and extract audio from services like YouTube, Vimeo, Mixcloud, Soundcloud etc. with a click of a button in your Dock.

# August 2017 note
A recent combination of youtube-dl & Python introduces the following error when trying to download videos from YouTube:
`insecure string pickle` ðŸ¥’

To fix, install libav:
`brew install libav`

Or update Python to 2.7.13:

# Installation
Download the __[virga.app](https://github.com/kopurando/virga.app-youtube-dl-GUI-for-OS-X/releases/download/1.0.5/virga.app.zip)__ into your Applications folder and drag its icon onto your Dock.  
The app uses notifications for output, so enable Banners for _Script editor_ in your Notifications Center for more verbose operation.

_Note: the app is currently unsigned (I am not a developer),_ thus you may need to open System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> General and allow virga.app to run. It is required only once. If this app becomes popular, I will sign the code to avoid this step.

## Usage

<a href="https://youtu.be/FW3T5_V0pT0" target="_blank"><img src="http://share.gifyoutube.com/Kr1XEQ.gif"></a>

1. Open a desired URL in Chrome or Safari.
2. Click the app icon in your Dock.
3. Files are downloaded into your _Downloads/from youtube and others/_ folder. 

You can start as many downloads as you like: everything will be done in parallel in the background.

The app uses an URL from the frontmost browser tab/window, and communicates back using Notification Center.  You can close or switch to another tab as soon as you click virga, download will finish in  background.

If you like to use [youtube-dl custom parameters](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl), just create `~/.config/youtube-dl/config` and virga will use it.

## Features
* GUI w/o interface: just click a button and job is done (most of the time)
* Downloads video or audio (or both) from any of the sites supported by youtube-dl ([full  list](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html), updated constantly)
* Downloads search results (e.g. search on youtube), __use with cauton!__ There is no "Stop" button yet :) 
* Multi-threaded: youtube-dl is forked, so the app can handle many simultaneous downloads
* Works with Safari and Chrome-based browsers
* Uses locally installed youtube-dl and ffmpeg or prepackaged ones (come inside virga.app bundle)
* Updates youtube-dl if media download fails (useful for ever changing Mixcloud...)
* Downloads whole playlists (i.e. all videos/audios from a playlist at URL)

## Prerequisites
_Default virga.app bundle includes youtube-dl, ffmpeg and rtmpdump._  
[youtube-dl](https://www.yt-dl.org) is used by this app. The app bundle  comes prepackaged with youtube-dl in it, but you can install youtube-dl manually (will be used if installed).  
ffmpeg is optional, but required for extracting audio from downloaded videos. Prebuilt ffmpeg binary comes inside virga.app as well.

__You can also download [virga barebone.app](https://github.com/kopurando/virga.app-youtube-dl-GUI-for-OS-X/releases/download/1.0.5/virga.barebone.app.zip) without youtube-dl, ffmpeg or rtmpdump bundled__ (in case you have them installed).

### To do
- ~~Work with any browser (Safari, Canary etc)~~
- ~~Auto-install ffmpeg and youtube-dl (if not installed)~~
- ~~Auto-update yt-dn on request~~
- Create an Apple dev. profile and sign the app bundle
- Stop button to abort downloads in progress (e.g. create pid-files and kill processes on repeated virga launch with the same URL?)
- Download progress output (e.g. use Dock badges or notifications center widgets?)
- Checkbox to open Terminal (for verbosity)
- Interactive notifications (open downloads folder or downloaded file)
- Resume after timeout/disconnection (catch "ERROR: unable to download video data: The read operation timed out", and retry download)  
- Write log file on errors (and open it on notification click)

It is my first experience with Applescript, and I think, it gave me significant brain damage already.  
It would be a good idea to re-write the app in Python, make it cross-platform and more feature-rich. Maybe next year... :)

This GUI was inspired by Efty Edge's workflow for Alfred app, but none of his code was used in the end.
